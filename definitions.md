Definitions
===========

These definitions are related to data and information management. There are other resources: 
[Consortia Advancing Standards in Research Administration Information](http://casrai.org/) (CASRAI) has two glossaries ([Research Admin Domain](http://dictionary.casrai.org/Category:Research_Admin_Domain), [Research Data Domain](http://dictionary.casrai.org/Category:Research_Data_Domain))  related to the topic that may be useful. My own interests are reflected below.
